# Dashcam-Speed-Predictor-Keras
Keras implementation of a LCRN (CNN+LSTM) based Speed Predictor from Dashcam video data.

This in an attempt to create a car speed predictor using Bidirectional LSTMs/GRUs. The data is features (Resnet50 : without FC layers) extracted from frames of a training video shot at 20FPS.
